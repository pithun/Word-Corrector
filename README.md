# Word-Corrector
A misspelt word corrector.
This was my first attempt to build a word corrector after i got curious as to how google corrects words. It uses a machine learning algorithm to get out possible 
correct words and then narrows it down using combinations. I started with majorly misspelt countries so my word dictionary majorly contains countries.
